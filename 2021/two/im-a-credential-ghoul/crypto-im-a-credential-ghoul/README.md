# Shared prime factor among pool of public RSA keys challenge
This challenge will require players to run the Euclidean Algorithm against a set
of RSA public keys in order to find a shared prime factor. Once this shared
prime is discovered, the player will have to construct a private key that
corresponds to one of the public keys that shares a prime.
