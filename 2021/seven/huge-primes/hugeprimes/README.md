# Challenge solution
One solution is to find the actual prime factors of 22952152323332505688670761214671498225451684330137990990356473040741684014997701799009910066964917896400501477 by actually factorizing it.
The solution is 618706242907094285939447607839 * 37097011039500744117766681095100420923783393727502071430377140015810453843499643 (I know because I generated these two primes and multipled them together :P)
This is nontrivial however, and not even I know the prime factors :P

However, all numbers in JavaScript are floats, and beyond 2^53 - 1, all numbers in js are floats. With a number as large as the one above, this means that the double precision representation of the number is:

1.0011100010111011111000001010110110101011111111100001 * 2^363

Which is equal to 22952152323332505416587153773067821404219604570062873267600242062142093944707836288883856033656043372550291456
(which is definitely NOT the same number!). In fact, with numbers that large, all numbers in js are actually just powers of 2 and thus, are even!

This leads to weird quirks, such as the fact that 22952152323332505416587153773067821404219604570062873267600242062142093944707836288883856033656043372550291456 == 22952152323332505688670761214671498225451684330137990990356473040741684014997701799009910066964917896400501477 returns true

We could thus bypass the check with something like this:
22952152323332505688670761214671498225451684330137990990356473040741684014997701799009910066964917896400501477 / 2 = 1.1476076161666253e+109

Note that this returns true:
1.1476076161666253e+109 * 2 == 22952152323332505688670761214671498225451684330137990990356473040741684014997701799009910066964917896400501477
